 Q 1 part a)>>>
BITWISE OPERATOR

The bitwise operators are the operators used to perform the operations on the data at the bit-level. When we perform the bitwise operations, then it is also known as bit-level programming. It consists of two digits, either 0 or 1. It is mainly used in numerical computations to make the calculations faster.
List of bitwise operators are ---
&	Bitwise AND operator
|	Bitwise OR operator
^	Bitwise exclusive OR operator
~	One's complement operator (unary operator)
<<	Left shift operator
>>	Right shift operator

EXAMPLE 

#include <stdio.h>
 int main()
{
   printf("AND value = %d\n",(m&n));
   printf("OR value = %d\n",(m|n));
   printf("NOT value = %d\n",(~m));
   printf("NOT value = %d\n",(~n));
   printf("XOR value = %d\n",(m^n));
   printf("left_shift value = %d\n",m << 1);
   printf("right_shift value = %d\n",m >> 1);
return 0;
}

TERNARY OPERATOR
 Ternary operator is used for decision making in place for longer if and else conditional statements.The ternary operator take three arguments that is the first is a comparison argument,the second being the result upon a true condition & the third is the result upon a false condition.

SYNTAX

(CONDITION)? STATEMENT1 : STATEMENT2;

EXAMPLE

#include <stdio.h>
 int main()
{
int a=10,b=20;
printf(" greater is %d\n",((a>b)?a:b));
return 0;
}
