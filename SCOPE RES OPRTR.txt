                        SCOPE RESOLUTION OPERATOR

The " :: " operator or scope resolution operator is used to get hidden names due to variable scopes so that we can still use them.
The scope resolution operator can be used as both unary and binary.
We can use the unary scope operator if a namespace scope or global scope name is hidden by a particular declaration of an equivalent name during a block or class.
